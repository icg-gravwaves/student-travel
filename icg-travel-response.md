Dear  Arthus

Thank you for completing the google form for a travel request to the above event in Sydney, Australia between 30 November - 11 December 2022. I am pleased to confirm your request has been approved by David Bacon. The cost centres for your trip are 10% 18387 40%  18371, 50% 41958 (we have to split these proportionately to match the split on your bursary.)

The next stage is to book travel and accommodation. Please contact Reed and MacKay (the
university travel bookers) with your travel itinerary, this needs to include dates, departure point,
arrival point and destination. Their contact details are:

a) +44 (0)20 8051 1824  
b) businessunit4@reedmackay.com (cc icg-travel@port.ac.uk)  
c) Office opening hours: Monday to Friday 0830 â€“ 1800  

Conference fees can be paid in a number of ways:

a) with a University credit card (contact ICG Admin)  
b) University bank transfer (you need to allow up to three weeks for this method)  
c) you can pay the fees yourself  yourself and claim using an ICG EFIN30 link: here  

If the conference organisers have preferential rates for accommodation you can provide Reed & Mackay with the details (eg promotion codes) to secure the rates. Alternatively if the conference
organiser includes the accommodation with the conference fee (e.g. University accommodation, not an hotel) ICG can pay for this in advance with the registration fee.

Once you have agreed your itinerary with Reed & Mackay they will require a Purchase Order Number (PO).  Please send all the details to the icg-travel@port.ac.uk email address and the admin team can raise the order and once authorised by finance can provide you with the PO number for Reed & Mackay, who will confirm the booking

Subsistence (local travel, meals etc) can be claimed after your trip using the ICG efin30. For guidance on rates please see the UoP travel policy (link: https://sites.google.com/port.ac.uk/travelandexpenses/policy?authuser=0) and overseas travel rates (link: https://sites.google.com/port.ac.uk/travelandexpenses/policy/overseas-scale-rates?authuser=0 .  Please note you cannot claim a per diem day rate for expenses, these are not considered to be an eligible cost by funded grants, you need to submit receipts for all costs incurred.

In exceptional circumstances, where Reed and Mackay are not used for travel bookings, (and has the authorisation of the Deputy Director of Finance in advance for this), you have to register your travel itinerary with Healix,.  They are contracted to provide advice and support to travellers whilst on University business, in the instances of a medical emergency, natural disaster, flight delays and other incidents such as terrorist attacks or civil unrest.

For links on the University portal you need to be connected to the VPN if working outside of the
University network.

If you have any questions please contact the Admin Team using this email address, icg-travel@port.ac.uk and enjoy your trip

Best wishes

ICG Manager
